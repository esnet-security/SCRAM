    """make_random_password replaces the deprecated django make_random_password function.

    Generates a random password of a specified length containing at least a specified number of digits using the
    official python best practices and some additional sanity checks. The python docs for this can be found at
    https://docs.python.org/3/library/secrets.html#recipes-and-best-practices. Note that generating long passwords
    with a high number of digits (>100) is inefficient and should be avoided. This password should only be used for
    temporary purposes, such as for a user to log in to the web interface and change their password.

    Args:
        length (int, optional): The total length of the password to generate. Defaults to 20.
        min_digits (int, optional): The minimum number of digits the password needs. Defaults to 5.
        max_attempts (int, optional): The maximum number of attempts to generate a valid password. Defaults to 10000.

    Raises:
        ValueError: Password length must be at least 1
        ValueError: min_digits cannot be negative
        ValueError: min_digits cannot exceed password length
        ValueError: For performance reasons, min_digits cannot exceed 30% of the password length
        RuntimeError: Failed to generate a valid password after max_attempts attempts

    Returns:
        password (str): The generated password.
